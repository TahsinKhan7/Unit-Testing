# TDD and unit testing
This lecture is about unit testing and TDD in python
One TDD's for many reasons, including: 
- Knowing when the project is done
- Goal keeping
- Maintainability
- Reducing technical depth
- Be able to working group
- It is what is expected in the industry
- And its fun :fire:


## What Tests Should I Write
Your tests are directly linked with product specifications. In an agile environment, expect the product owner and scrum master will come up with project specs
Your tests will mirror these specs.


### Example Specs
These are the specs your product owner and scrum master have produced during their meetings:

- There should be a calculator object
- It should add two numbers
- It should subtract two numbers
- It should multiply two
- It should divide two numbers
- Nice to have: It could keep the last result in memory.
